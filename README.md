This is the C++ code that I wrote in undergraduate Computational Physics the Fall of 2015 at the University of Texas at Arlington.

Included in these files is the C++ code, Excel plots, and reports dealing with the following:
    
    Kinematics
    Nuclear Decay
    Numeric Integration
    Oscillations
    Planetary Motion
    Random Walks
    Population Equations
